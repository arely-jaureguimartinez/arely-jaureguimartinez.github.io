  <h1 class="maintitle"> ~About Arely~</h1>
<p> If the title is not clear enough for you, well<br>
  my name is Arely. I am currently a first year SMASH scholar<br>
  with quite a lot of enthusiasm. I try to maintain my positive<br>
  attitude as much as I can. I consider myself mature at mind,<br>
  but childish at energy, only sometimes.</p>
<p>I really enjoy cartoon characters, so please enjoy this gif of my<br>
    beloved winnie the pooh, a cuddly cute bear.</p>

  <section> I enjoy reading poetry and a genre<br>
        of poetry I enjoy is those old classic poems <br>
        such as poems by Shakespeare and Pablo Neruda.<br>
        I feel like I enjoy these poems because they are<br>
        corny, so here goes a poem by Skakespeare named<br>
        Sonnet 130:<br><p>
        My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
I grant I never saw a goddess go;
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:
   And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
   As any she belied with false compare.</p>
