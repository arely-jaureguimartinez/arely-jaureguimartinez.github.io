  <h1>Goals and Ideas</h1>
  <p> The days here have just been amazing although I sometimes feel homesick. I hope to learn alot and just absorb many new teachings from everyone.</p>
  <p>A goal I have is to get good at THIS, and I have the hopes that I WILL!!("View" - "Developer" - "Developer Tools").</p>
  <p>Another goal I have is to have good communication with everyone</p>
  <p>I hope to maintain my relationship strong with my SO even though we are far and now have less time for each other, but we make time for each other.
